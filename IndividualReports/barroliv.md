# Learning Reflection
### What I have Learnt
Through the course of COMP313 I learnt a great deal about what it means to collaboratively work on a project. As the Owl of the group, I made early to list down features the team would like to see in the final product. And although I was not the team leader of the project (nor responsible for organizing), I utilized Kyle's (the Bear) standups early to establish my own goals for my role.

The other biggest skill I will take away from this project is a better understanding of C# and creating things within Unity3D. While C# is not something I regularly work with, I believe having learnt a basic understanding will help me with future projects. Not only for the sake of knowing new languages, but C# is the first scripting language I have learnt. While I have by no means mastered it, I found using C# with Unity to be very simple and easy to pick up, and I hope to use it again.

The final important skill I have learnt through this project is a basic understanding of how the __Design__ works. Developing maps and character animations were not my tasks in this project, but just simply working with students who have this different field of expertise has really helped me to understand how each component of a game adds together. As a software developer, I'm glad to have learnt more about the designers process, as I could very well be working with them in the future.
